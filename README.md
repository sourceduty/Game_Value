[Game Value](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-lR3BxufXF-game-value) is designed to help users find and compare video game prices efficiently. By integrating with the CheapShark API, it allows users to search for games by title and retrieve detailed pricing information. Users can find a list of games matching their search, sorted by price, to ensure they get the best deals. The tool prioritizes affordability and ease of access, displaying a maximum of 25 results for each search to maintain simplicity and relevance. Whether users are browsing options for a specific game or exploring a broader selection, Game Value ensures that they receive accurate, up-to-date price comparisons.

Additionally, Game Value provides detailed information for specific games when requested. This includes the game's title, price, availability, and the stores offering it. If a game is unavailable or cannot be found, the GPT clearly communicates that to the user, avoiding any confusion. By focusing on price transparency and user-friendly interactions, Game Value is a tailored assistant for gamers looking to save money and make informed purchasing decisions in the competitive gaming market.
